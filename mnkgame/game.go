Order and Chaos is a variant of the game tic-tac-toe on a 6Ã—6 gameboard with 5 in a row

Something like Three Mens Morris or Nine Mens Morris would require a little more logic
in the OpenPositions and ApplyMove.


TODO(rsned): Update game to allow custom rule handling for moves.  e.g. Connect4
only takes moves using columns but not rows, and then 'gravity' moves the marker
to the next available row slot in the column.
