# *m*-*n*-*k* game library package.

This package is a Go library for implementing a variety of the classic
 *m*-*n*-*k* type games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Naughts and Crosses, Connect 4,
Gomoku and many others.

Per [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M,n,k-game](Wikipedia):
An m,n,k-game is an abstract board game in which two players take turns in
placing a stone of their color on an m-by-n board, the winner being the 
player who first gets k stones of their own color in a row, horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally. Thus, tic-tac-toe is the 3,3,3-game and
free-style gomoku is the 15,15,5-game. An m,n,k-game is also called a 
k-in-a-row game on an m-by-n board.
